# MyReads Project

This is my project submission for the Udacity React Fundamentals course.
It was built using the starter template provided at https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter.

## TL;DR

To run the app:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
